# Dynamic-Lot-Sizing-Methods
Dynamic lot sizing methods are critical for determining the optimal order quantity and timing for production or purchasing of goods. These methods take into account the demand for the product, the setup cost of production or ordering, and the holding cost of inventory to minimize the overall cost of production and inventory while meeting customer demand.

In this repository, I have implemented 11 dynamic lot sizing methods in Python, including:

EQI (Economic Order Interval)
EQQ (Economic Order Quantity)
FOI (Fixed Order Period)
FOQ (Fixed Order Quantity)
LFL (Lot for Lot)
LTC (Least Total Cost)
LUC (Least Unit Cost)
POQ (Periodic Order Quantity)
PPB (Part Period Balancing)
SM (Silver Meal Heuristic Method)
W2 (Wagner Whitin Algorithm)

Each method's implementation and other details can be found in the repository.
